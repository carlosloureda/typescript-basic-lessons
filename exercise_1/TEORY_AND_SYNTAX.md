# TYPE

Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

## Primitive Types

## Object Types

With this types we can do some tricks that are not possible with the prmitive types

- functions
- arrays
- classes (Date)

- They are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowting around our codebase.
